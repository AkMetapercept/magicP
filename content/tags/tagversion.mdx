# Tag Version

Every tag includes a version number on the top right corner of the screen. Once the tag is published, the Version is set to 1. That is Version 1. 
After subsequent edits and only after publishing the version number keeps on updating to the latest version such as Version 2, version 3, and so on.

Until the Tag is published, the status displays as **Pending Publish**. Once the Tag is Published, the status is updated as **Production**.
