# Provider Version

Every Provider includes a version number on the top right corner of the screen. Once the Provider is published, the Version is set to 1. That is Version 1. 
After subsequent edits and only after publishing, the version number keeps on updating to the latest version such as Version 2, version 3, and so on.

**Note**: For the default Providers, the version is always set to “1” because these are populated from the template.
Until the Provider is published, the status displays as **Pending Publish**. Once the Provider is Published, the status is updated as **Production**.
