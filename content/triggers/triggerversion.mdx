# Trigger Version

Every Trigger includes a version number on the top right corner of the screen. Once the Trigger is published, the Version is set to 1. That is Version 1. 
After subsequent edits and only after publishing, the version number keeps on updating to the latest version such as Version 2, version 3, and so on.

**Note**: For the default Triggers, the version is always set to “1” because these are populated from the template.

**Note**: Until the Trigger is published, the status displays as **Pending Publish**. Once the Trigger is Published, the status is updated as **Production**.
