# Triggers

The Triggers indicates when a particular tag is to be triggered based on the data inputs. Different triggers are associated with the different actions and events while performing the tasks under tags. Some of the examples for triggers include Product View, View cart, Add to cart, View price, View item, View Payment, and so on. Also, the Qualification Criteria provides the additional criteria to indicate more specific instances of when the tag must be triggered. While the Triggers are mandatory, Qualification Criteria is optional.
